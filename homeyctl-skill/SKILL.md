# Homey

Control your Athom Homey Pro smart home hub using the `homeyctl` CLI. This skill enables device control, flow automation, energy monitoring, and system management through Homey's local API.

## Setup & Configuration

### Automatic Setup (Easiest)

If user can use browser:
```bash
homeyctl login
```

This handles authentication and discovery automatically.

### Manual Setup (For AI/Automation)

If user provides token from https://my.homey.app/ → Settings → API Keys:

1. **Get Homey hostname/IP:**
   - Ask user: "What is your Homey's IP address or hostname?"
   - User can find this in Homey app or on https://my.homey.app/ (Settings → System)
   - Format: IP like `192.168.1.100` or `.local` hostname like `homey-xxxxx.local`

2. **Configure:**
```bash
homeyctl config set-host <user-provided-host>
homeyctl config set-token <user-provided-token>
```

3. **Verify:**
```bash
homeyctl devices list
```

Configuration is stored in `~/Library/Application Support/homeyctl/config.toml` (macOS).

## Quick Start

```bash
# Get complete system snapshot
homeyctl snapshot
homeyctl snapshot --include-flows

# List all devices
homeyctl devices list

# Control a device (multiple ways)
homeyctl devices on "Living Room Light"      # Shortcut
homeyctl devices off "Living Room Light"     # Shortcut
homeyctl devices set "Living Room Light" dim 0.5

# Trigger a flow
homeyctl flows trigger "Good Morning"

# Activate a mood
homeyctl moods set "Movie Time"

# Check presence and weather
homeyctl presence get me
homeyctl weather current

# Check energy usage
homeyctl energy live
homeyctl energy report day
```

## Security: Token Scoping

**Important:** For AI assistants, use scoped tokens to prevent accidental changes.

The user should create a readonly token for you:
```bash
homeyctl token create "AI Bot" --preset readonly --no-save
```

Available presets:
- **readonly** - Safe for AI exploration (list/get only)
- **control** - Read + control devices, trigger flows
- **full** - Full access (same as owner)

If you try an operation without permissions, you'll see: `Error: 403 Missing Scopes`

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Device Control

List and control all connected smart home devices:

```bash
# List all devices (lights, sensors, thermostats, etc.)
homeyctl devices list
homeyctl devices list --filter "living"  # Filter by name pattern

# Get device details (capabilities, state, zone)
homeyctl devices get "Living Room Light"

# Control devices (multiple ways)
homeyctl devices on "Living Room Light"           # Shortcut (turns on)
homeyctl devices off "Living Room Light"          # Shortcut (turns off)
homeyctl devices set "Living Room Light" dim 0.5  # Set specific capability
homeyctl devices set "Thermostat" target_temperature 22

# Device management
homeyctl devices rename "Old Name" "New Name"
homeyctl devices move "Device" "Kitchen"          # Move to zone
homeyctl devices hide "Device"                    # Hide from views
homeyctl devices delete "Old Device"

# Device settings (separate from capabilities)
homeyctl devices settings get "Device"
homeyctl devices settings set "Device" setting_name value
```

### 2. Flow Management

Manage Homey flows (automations):

```bash
# List all flows
homeyctl flows list
homeyctl flows list --filter "morning"  # Filter by name pattern

# Get flow details (use to see structure)
homeyctl flows get "My Flow"

# Trigger a flow by name
homeyctl flows trigger "Good Morning"

# Update existing flow (merge)
homeyctl flows update "My Flow" updated-flow.json

# Delete a flow
homeyctl flows delete "Old Flow"

# List available flow cards (for creating flows)
homeyctl flows cards --type trigger
homeyctl flows cards --type condition
homeyctl flows cards --type action

# Flow folders (organize flows)
homeyctl flows folders list
homeyctl flows folders create "Automation"
homeyctl flows folders get "Automation"
homeyctl flows folders update "Automation" updated-folder.json
homeyctl flows folders delete "Old Folder"
```

**Flow structure:** See `references/homeyctl-ai-context.md` for complete flow JSON format and examples.

### 3. Energy Monitoring

Track power usage and electricity prices:

```bash
# Live power usage (W)
homeyctl energy live

# Daily/weekly/monthly/yearly reports
homeyctl energy report day
homeyctl energy report week
homeyctl energy report month --date 2025-12
homeyctl energy report year --date 2025

# Check/set electricity prices
homeyctl energy price                    # Show dynamic prices
homeyctl energy price set 0.50          # Set fixed price (kr/kWh)
homeyctl energy price type              # Show current type
homeyctl energy price type fixed        # Switch to fixed pricing
```

### 4. Insights & Historical Data

Access historical sensor data and logs:

```bash
# List all insight logs
homeyctl insights list

# Get historical data for a device
homeyctl insights get "homey:device:abc123:measure_power"

# Different time resolutions

homeyctl variables list

# Get/set variable value
homeyctl variables get "my_variable"
homeyctl variables set "my_variable" 42

# Create/delete variable
homeyctl variables create "new_var" number 0
homeyctl variables delete "new_var"
```

### 6. Zones & Users
